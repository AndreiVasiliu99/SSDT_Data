# SSDT_Data
To run the study, please download the SSDT_R folder on your computer, open the R file and press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. This command runs the enitre code.
Please make sure you keep the EXCEL files containing the participant data in the same folder as the R file, otherwise the code will not work.
Participants 10 and 17 were removed from the analysis as we found out retrospectively that they were aged 18, while our study was recruiting only participants aged 19-45.
